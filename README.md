With my passion for coding, growing my portfolio further everyday, and with the ownership to a domain. I've decided to work on a website that would showcase my coding portfolio.
Tinkering around with many ideas, found one that I decided to design and execute it into existence.

## [Home](https://10eti.xyz/) Page
The home page that would greet the user upon entering the website, has a background that is a gradience linked to the movement of cursor that followed the position of cursor when moved, providing a smooth background animation that was subtle.

## [Projects](https://10eti.xyz/projects) Page 
A good portfolio website is unfulfilled of it's definition without showcasing your projects, so all the projects I've worked on are featured with a drop down menu showing greater description to the reason behind the project, along with images for some. 

## [Contact](https://10eti.xyz/projects) Page
And ofcourse, a portfolio is left incomplete without a way to contacting the person behind the projects, so the contact page held everyway I could be contacted.
